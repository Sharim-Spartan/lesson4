#TDD
#####there are two method of testing: Unit testing and PyTesting
#####there are three process behind TDD (Test Driven Development): Pass, Fail and Refactor
#####In modular programming there will be at least two files: 1) code file and 2) run file
#####code file contains the class and the run file is where you call them
##### there will also be test suite where
##### the Assertions are test cases
##### write the smallest possible test case that matcher what need to program
#####run the test and watch it fail. this gets tou into thinking how write onky code that makes it pass
#####write some code with the goal of the making the test pas
#####run your test suite. repeat steps 3 and 4 until alll tests passs
#####go back and refoactor your new code. making it as simple and clear as possible while keeping the test suite green

###How to TDD
#####you think about what you intend to build
#####separate task into logical testable blocks
#####ensure that the tests can run against your class to make sure it does what it is meant to do
